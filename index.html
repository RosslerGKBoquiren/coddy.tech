	<h1>Rossler Boquiren's HTML Website</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to my first HTML website where I demonstrate basic HTML skills on a simple website.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>First, I use the basics such as <strong>BOLD</strong> or <em>Italics</em> to emphasize certain words above others.</p>

        <p>Second, I attach a photo to highlight my interest in anything Japanese related content such as a cute photo of Takoyaki! It is one
            of my favourite Japanese foods after all.</p><br>

        <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/delicious-takoyaki-into-cardboard-bowl_52683-45978.jpg?w=1380&t=st=1696452554~exp=1696453154~hmac=7bdbb0a7085457181804760776799420508f1f86e374776be6da91ec79d17519" 
            alt="Cute Takoyaki" width="300" height="300">

            <h6><em>The photo above is resized at width and height of 300px</em></h6>

        <p>Third, I will include an ordered list of things that I have scheduled to study as I progress with Web Development</p>

            <ol>
                <li id="li1">CSS</li>
                <li id="li2">Javascript</li>
                <li id="li3">React</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I am, however, enrolled at Herzing College in Montreal, QC Canada, for my second college diploma because the college has an opportunity
                for graduates to study another program for free!<br> Therefore, I decided to take this opportunity and enrolled in their Web Programming cirriculum,
                which will include, but not limited to the following list of courses: </p>

                <ul id="categorytList">
                    <li>Programming Languages:
                        <ul id="specificLanguages">
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>C#</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>My SQL Database</li>
                    <li>And more!</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>End</h2>
